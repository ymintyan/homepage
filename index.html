                    <p>I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!</p>

                    <p>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
